Hello! Welcome to our Application, Beat Stride!

This is a bare react native project.
Remember to run ``npm install`` before you try to run the application.

Use ``npx react-native run-androind`` to initiate the application.

Do note that this repo does not contain the firebase config file for privacy reasons. 
Do set up your own file as "firebase.js"  and insert it into the directory './src/api/firebase.js'.

Additionally, this app requires spotify premium to function normally (freely navigate between songs).

Enjoy!
